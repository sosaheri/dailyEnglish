A.M and P.M
Since the 24-hour time zone is not used in English, (time is expressed with 12-hour time zones in English) the hours must be divided into two;

 

 

‘before noon’  and ‘after noon’.

For the hours before noon ( 00:01 – 12:00),  we use a.m. (Ante meridiem)

For the hours after noon ( 12:01 -24:00 ), we use p.m. (Post meridiem)

 

Examples:

02:00 am = It is two o’clock before noon

02:00 pm = It is two o’clock after noon

( 2 am, 08:00 pm, 6 PM, 3 A.M, etc… )

Note: “a.m.” and “p.m.” markers can not be used with “past / to”



Morning                     = 00:01 – 11:59

noon or midday        = 12:00

afternoon                  = 12:01 – 18:00

evening                      = 18:01 – 22:00

night                           = 22:01 – 24:00

midnight                    = 24:00 / 00:00

a.m. – (the time between midnight and noon)          00:01 – 12:00

p.m. – (the time after noon ( not afternoon ))           12:01 – 24:00
